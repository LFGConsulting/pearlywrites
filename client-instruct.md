## 🌐 How It All Works

## 📨 Setting Up Contact Form (Formspree)

Your contact form is powered by Formspree. To activate it:

1. Go to **https://formspree.io/** and sign up for an account
2. Click **"New Form"** and choose a name (e.g., "PearlyWrites Contact")
3. Select the **"Basic"** plan (free) to start
4. Copy your form's unique **ID** (looks like `xrgdkpaz`)
5. Send the ID to your developer to activate the form

What you'll get:
- Email notifications for each form submission
- Spam protection
- Access to a dashboard of all submissions
- GDPR compliance out of the box

> 💡 The form will appear to work on the site but won't send emails until properly configured with your Formspree ID.
